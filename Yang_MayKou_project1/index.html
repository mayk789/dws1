<p>I'm a huge fan of oysters. However, I don't consider myself a <em>connoisseur</em>. I'm just a foodie and oysters just so happens to be somewhere around the top of my list of favorite foods. Yes, a part of me would have to agree that it probably is an acquired taste but it could also be that some people just haven't had the right type of oysters. Here, I'll go though a little of the basics.</p>
